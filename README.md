# placeholder-gpt

placeholder-gpt is a Discord bot written in python that uses the OpenAI API to produce bot responses.

95% of the code for this bot was written by GPT-4, and the first version was entirely written by mimicking the GPT-4 devleoper livestream (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ)

This version of the bot uses a single python script (discord_bot.py) and runs locally in VScode.

For this code to work, you must configure a Discord app and bot using the Discord administrative interface and set DISCORD_TOKEN and OPENAI_API_KEY environment variables on your local machine.
